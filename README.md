In this research work, Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), also known as acute lymphocytic leukemia, is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow in children
ALL is a fast-moving disease that occurs when the bone marrow produces too many abnormal white blood cells called lymphoblasts. These immature blood cells can't fight infection and crowd out normal blood-forming cells. 
ALL is the most common type of cancer in children, accounting for about 25% of all childhood cancers in the United States. It's most common in children aged 1 to 4 years. 
Symptoms can include:Pale skin, Feeling tired, weak, or cold Dizziness, Headaches, Shortness of breath or trouble breathing 
Treatment typically lasts about 2 to 3 years, with the most intense treatment in the first few months. The type and dose of drugs given depends on the child's risk group. 
ALL has one of the highest cure rates of all childhood cancers, with about 85% of newly diagnosed patients becoming event-free survivors.
In this research work the python code is developed for the following methods: EfficientNetv2B0 with Relu, Efficentnetv2B0 with leaky Relu, Efficentnetv2B3 with leaky Relu, EffNetV2B3 with Parametric Relu, LeNet, AlexNet, ResNet and CNN
